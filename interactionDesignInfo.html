              I believe this section is an incredibly visual one. I really like this PDF that usability.gov has; it provides clear images and explanations 
              for how to create a good webpage (in basics). Way easier to read than a block of text! 
            </p>

              Lets also talk a little bit about typography. Make sure that your type is big enough to read. Imagine putting it up on a big monitor; is the type still 
              readable? It's reccomended to aim for 18 points (about). Make sure that there is plenty of vertical tracking between your lines of text, and that rather than 
              spanning the whole width of the screen, you set a body text width limit so that its still readable even on wide screens. 
            </p>

            <p>
              For paragraph text, make sure thats you use a readable font! Sans serif stuff is good for this, as well as serif fonts that are simple, such as the classic 
              Times New Roman. For headings, they can be a little more decorative than your body text, but make sure their still readable. Avoid fonts with lots of fancy 
              glyphs. 
            </p>

            <p>
              A good way to make sure that your websit meets these standards is heurstic evaluation! This is a method of finding usability problems. You can go through the 
              checklist yourself, but there are also professionals who go through the checklist and send back reccomnendations at many companies.

                You can also make user personas to further test how your website appears through another set of eyes. This somewhat overlaps with creating personas of 
                disabled users to understand how they interact with the web, so I won't go into too much detail here.
