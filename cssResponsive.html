            <p>
              The two key components of CSS response layouts are CSS grids and CSS flexbox. Lets start with the CSS grid!
            </p>

            <p>
              The CSS grid changed the game for me with coding (because, embarrassingly enough, I had never learned it before). Put super simply, you make a grid using 
              CSS, and then you assign certain elements to that grid. For example, you can list out a grid and label the top portion of that grid "header", then asign 
              your header to that space. It's a super simple way to lay out a webpage, and its accessible. 
            </p>

            <p>Chris Coyier has an excellent guide on it, with incredibly helpful pictures, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
              CSS flexbox is hard to describe with words. It's a bit like a responsive container that will lay out items within it in a specified way. Again I must defer 
              to Chris Coyier's guide on CSS flexbox, which has excellent pictures that explain this concept far better than words.
