                <p>
                    Fu Xuan is nigh unkillable, and due to her ability to deflect the damage that the 
                    team takes to her, it makes the entire team unkillable. She has so many tools in her 
                    kit that practically make her an immovable wall it's insane. She is extremely good at 
                    what she doesâ€¦ which being tanking damage and keeping your team alive indirectly she is a 
                    great option as a defensive unit and easily will be able to solo sustain your team!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her only con is that she relies upon her ultimate in order to provide team and personal heals. 
                    Considerate timing in battle, especially battles with enemies that are aggressive and deal high 
                    AOE damage, is required. Additionally, keep in mind her energy recharge when building her relics
                    to ensure that she can reliably and consistently ult and keep her stacks of healing up.
                </p>

                <h3 id="fuxuanLightcone">Fu Xuan's Lightcone</h3>

                <h4>She Already Shut Her Eyes</h4>
                <p>
                    Fu Xuan's signature lightcone is called "She Already Shut her Eyes". This lightcone is incredibly
                    overpowered. It heals the entire team and buffs damage percent. This lightcone takes Fu Xuan from 
                    simply a preservation unit to a multi-role harmony and abundance unit. Of course, as with all signature 
                    lightcones, this is a premium option and you must contend with the fickle nature of the lightcone banner. 
                </p>

                <h4>Texture of Memories</h4>
                <p>
                    Another great five star lightcone for Fu Xuan is "Texture of Memories", which is free in the Simulated
                    Universe Herta Shop. This the best lightcone for making Fu Xuan unkillable. This also gives Effect RES, 
                    which is important for the Keel relic set.  
                </p>
                
                <h4>Moment of Victory</h4>
                <p>
                    This is Gepard's signature lightcone that can be obtained through the standard banner. This is a premium 
                    option for Fu Xuan, and a good generalist five star lightcone for most preservation units. 
                </p>

                <h4>Landau's Choice</h4>
                <p>
                    This is Fu Xuan's best 4 star lightcone option. This lightcone gives more damage reduction, which means more 
                    sustain for Fu Xuan. This also increases taunt on her. 
                </p>

                <h4>Anything Else</h4>
                <p>
                    Fu Xuan is versatile, so she's not reliant on any one lightcone to work. Therefore, you can use any preservation
                    lightcone effectively if needed. 
                </p>

                <h3 id="fuxuanRelics">Fuxuan's Relics</h3>

                <h4>Guard</h4>
                <p>
                    A 4pc guard relic set gives both energy and healing when her HP is under 50%. This is the best set for a pure survival
                    build.
                </p>

                <h4>Longevous</h4>
                <p>
                    A 4pc Longevous set will be Fu Xuan's best mix between damage and sustain.
                </p>

                <h4>Genius</h4>
                <p>
                    A 4pc Genius set would be her best damage option, but isn't reccomended for her sustain builds. This is a relatively niche 
                    build.
                </p>

                <h4>2pc Combos</h4>
                <p>
                    2pc combos of Guard, Longevous, and Knight are also great optoins for sustain, and are more efficient to farm.
                </p>

                <h4>Keel</h4>
                <p>
                    This is in overpowered set on her, and gives 10% crit damage to all party members.
                </p>

                <h4>Fleet</h4>
                <p>
                    Gives 8% ATK% to all party members. This is a fairly good set, but Keel is better. 
                </p>

                <h3 id="fuxuanSynergies">Fuxuan's Synergies</h3>

                <p>
                    Fu Xuan is incredibly flexible; she can find her place in any team that needs a sustain unit. She works especially well with units 
                    that require being damaged for their kit, like Blade, as her sustain comes mostly through her damage reduction. She is especially touted 
                    for her ability to function in mono quantum teams.

            <p>
                Level her talent first, then her ultimate, and then her basic attack (if you level it at all). Fu xuan makes good use out of all her talents 
                so I'd recommend leveling them all (excluding her basic attack).
