            <h2>The Language of Design</h2>

            <h3>Norman's Design Concepts</h3>

            <p>
              Norman's design principles, from the book <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>, are a great broad brush that we can use to understand 
              the basic principles of how we go about designing things that are universally usable. Design is first and foremost about functionality, 
              think about what your design is communicating to the user, and how it communicates!
            </p>

            <p>
              Below I've listed out Norman's design principles, with abbreviated versions of their overall meanings. I highly reccommend reading the book 
              yourself for a more indepth approach. You can also check out <i>Universal Design for Digital Media</i> by Howard Kramer for a less abbreviated 
              summary.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Visibility:</b> The more visible an element is, the more likely users will know about it and how to use it. The opposite is also true!</li>
              <li>
                <b>Feedback:</b> Make it clear to the user when an action has been taken and what has been accomplished. This can be achieved through visual, tactile, 
                audio and more!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Constraints:</b> Limit the range of possible interactions for the user to simplify the interface and guide the user to the next appropriate action.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Mapping:</b> Create a clear relationship between the controls and the effect they have on the world. This is one of the more difficult concepts to understand 
                with words alone. Think about a stovetop; place the controls in a way where the user can understand which dial turns out which burner. Instead of laying 
                them out in a straight line, lay them out in the same scheme as the burners!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Consistency:</b> Have similar operations and similar elements for achieving similar tasks! Also use menus and layouts that users are familiar with from other 
                websites. Utilize the language that the web has created. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Affordance:</b> Give your designed objects attributes that let the user know how to use that attribute. For example, a door handle should have a 
                area that looks like it can be pulled, but when pushing a door present a bar or other pushable object instead. 
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Identifying Norman's Design Concepts on the Web</h3>

            <p>
              Generally, you want to make sure that everything you have your user do is simple, well mapped, and easy to understand. If you need the user to do a more complex 
              task, break it down into simpler tasks first. Make sure that the user understands where their going on your website and how to do a task there. Remember to make it 
              difficult or impossible to do things that the user shouldn't be doing; code for mistakes. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember not to overautomate as well! Give your user a sense of autonomy, so they can choose where to go and how to get there. This is a hard balance to strike, 
              but an important one. 
            </p>

            <h3>The History of the Web and Web Design</h3>

            <p>
              To understand how to be good web designers today, understanding the history of web design is important. What decisions and events led to the web we know today? 
              How can we move forward without repeating the mistakes of our past, and replicating the positives? 
            </p>

            <p>
              The web used to be a "wild west" of sorts when it came to the ways that websites were built. While this was somethign that allowed for a deluge of creative 
              digital art through web, it also raised concerns of accessiblity and usability, especially when these websites were meant to me usable rather than artistic 
              expression.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1998, Internet Explorer 5 released a new proprietary dynamic HTML, and this necessitated web standards for web developers and designers. WaSP (Web Standards 
              Project) was formed to address this need. This group ridiculed companies that were a part of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and didn't follow web standards, 
              instead breaking the rules for their own gain. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, we reached a point where much of the web is standardized, but we still have much work to do to make our websites accessible from the jump for all users. 
            </p>

            <p>
              We've learned from these trailblazers what a good web design needs. Clear layouts, strong mapping, and easy to navigate simplistic front pages are all 
              essential. This ties into Norman's design principles! Usable websites are a must!
