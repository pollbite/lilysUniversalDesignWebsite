            <h2>Intro to Web Standards</h2>
      
            <p>
              Ever looked at code and saw a bloated mess of a million divs? Web standards seek to avoid this coding nightmare. Using web standards when coding will make clean, 
              clear websites. This is important for screen readers, so that users can figure out what section their in! On the end of the designer and/or developer, this is 
              nice too. You can actually parse whats happening and what section your in when your reading someone elses code. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="HTMLCoding">HTML Coding</h3>

            <p>
                This guide assumes you know the basics of coding with HTML and CSS, so I won't go in depth with that. Just know that the head needs to contain a title, 
                language, etc. (vscode does this for you automatically). Also remember that your body must have structure! Make sure all your sections are labeled, and 
                that you have headings for everything that needs headings. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than me explaining web standards in depth, I would rather point you to good resources. Check out WAI's website, the aforementioned 
              <i>Universal Design for Digital Media</i>, and Mozilla's developer website!
