            <h1>Universal Design</h1>

            <h2>Intro to Universal Design</h2>

            <p>
              Welcome all! This website is meant to be a abbreviated summary of how to code accessibly; why its important, and the basics of how 
              to get started. I would also reccommend checking out the WCAG for some really in depth, awesome guides. Let's get started!
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Universal Design is the framework to accessible design. Universal Design not only addresses the needs of those with disabilities, 
              but also addresses the needs of a wide variety of people with a diverse set of abilities. For example, a wheelchair accessible 
              ramp is not only important for a wheelchair user, but also for a mother with a stroller or a delivery person with a cart.
            </p>

            <figure class="squareImage">
              <img src="./img/accessibleRamp.jpg" alt="concrete accessible ramp in front of a fast food place">
            </figure>

            <p>
              There are also wide reaching benefits to designing universally. It is no secret that our population is aging rapidly. As we grow older
              we often develop disabilities, and must rely upon accessible tech to move forward. In 2022 the National Census found the number of 
              people over 80 years of age increased by 25% since the 2016 census. This same National Census found that the percentage of persons in Ireland
              with disabilities increased 22% from the 2016 census. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Technology is pivotal to today's world, and therefore must be accessible for everyone. The majority of people do everything online now; banking, 
              paying bills, ordering essential goods. As society progresses, we will only become more and more reliant on technology, and therefore we must 
              make that technology accessible for all. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Accesibility should not be an afterthought either. We should start with implementing accessibility into our technology, rather than changing it 
              after the fact. Implementing accessbility from the start is often cheaper than implementing it later, and less difficult. Additionally, it means 
              that we can guarentee that that accessibility feature is truly accessible. In physical products and buildings, implementing accessibility from the
              beginning also improves that accessbilities aesthetic as well. 
            </p>

            <p>
              One past solution that is uneffective for web design accessbility is text only sites. Text only sites are often not updated with the main site, and 
              even when they are, they lack key information. Images are key information, and alt text sites often don't have any implementation of alt text. 
              Making sure that content is accessible should not be an afterthought; much like with physical design our products and coding are overall of worse 
              quality when we do not considering a broad spectrum of users. 
            </p>

            <h3>Principles of Universal Design and POUR</h3>

            <p>
              Now that we've established the importance of accessibility, we should discuss its general principles. These principles are important things that 
              must be considered as we design. Lets start with a framework of design principles taken from the book <i>A Web for Everyone</i>: 
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>People First: Designing for Differences:</b>
                People are the first consideration, and sites are designed with the needs of everyone in the audience in mind.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Clear Purpose: Well-Defined Goals:</b>
                People enjoy products that are designed for the audience and guided by a defined purpose and goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Solid Structure: Built to Standards</b>
                People feel confident using the design because it is stable, robust, and secure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Easy Interaction: Everything Works</b>
                People can use the product across all modes of interaction and operating with a broad range of devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Helpful Wayfinding: Guides Users</b>
                People can navigate a site, feature, or page following self-explanatory signposts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Clean Presentation: Supports Meaning</b>
                People can perceive and understand elements in the design.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Plain Language: Creates a Conversation</b>
                People can read, understand, and use the information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Accessible Media: Supports All Senses</b>
                People can understand and use information contained in media such as images, audio, video, animation, and presentations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Universal Usability: Creates Delight</b>
                People can focus on the experience and their own goals because the product anticipates their needs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This set of principles is geared towards web design, but can be applicable in many different fields of design. They are based on the 
              two foundational sets of principles; the Principles of Universal Design, created in 1996 by a group of designers, architects and 
              rehabilitation engineers, and the POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust), an acronym created by the W3C Web Accessibility
              Initiative (WAI). 
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's start with POUR's principles:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Perceivable:</b> Information and user interface components must be
                presented to users in ways they can see or hear.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Operable:</b> User interface components and navigation must be
                designed so that users can interact with them and they can support
                assistive technologies such as screen readers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Understandable:</b> Information and the operation of user interface must
                communicate clearly and consistently so that the content is readable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Robust:</b> Content must be written so that it can be interpreted reliably
                by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Now, we'll take a look at the Principles of Universal Design. While these principles are mmore general in their approach, they are still essential 
              to our understanding of Universal Design, and foundational to the Universal Design concept. These principles are as follows: 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Equitable Use:</b> The design does not disadvantage or stigmatize any
                group of users.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Flexibility in Use:</b> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Simple, Intuitive Use:</b> Use of the design is easy to understand,
                regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Perceptible Information:</b> The design communicates necessary
                information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions
                or the user's sensory abilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Tolerance for Error:</b> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse
                consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Low Physical Effort:</b> The design can be used efficiently, comfortably,
                and with a minimum of fatigue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</b> Appropriate size and space
                is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of
                the user's body size, posture, or mobility.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diversity of Web Users</h3>

            <p>
              Disability is not one size fits all; there is a broad spectrum of disabled users that will use your website. I'll give you a cursory introduction of some possible 
              disabilities that your users may have here, but I reccomend diving deeper by visiting WAI's website and speaking to disabled people in your community. 
            </p>

            <h4>Auditory</h4>

            <p>
              Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears 
              (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background 
              noise. This can include people using hearing aids.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of auditory disabilities:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hard of hearing</b> - mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Deafness</b> - substantial, uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Deaf-blindness</b> - substantial, uncorrectable hearing and visual impairments.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of barriers for people with auditory disabilities:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without captions or transcripts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide volume controls.
              </li>
              <li>
                Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text that is difficult to read.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cognitive, Learning and Neurological</h4>

            <p>
              Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health 
              disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, 
              speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of cognitive, learning and neurological disabilties:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (formerly “attention deficit disorder (ADD)”)</b> - involves difficulty focusing on a single task, 
                focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (includes “autism,” “Asperger syndrome,” and “pervasive developmental disorder” (PDD))</b> - involves impairments of social 
                communication and interaction abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Intellectual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Europe and some other countries, and “developmental disabilities” in other regions)</b> - 
                involves impairments of intelligence, learning more slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome is one among many different causes of 
                intellectual disabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Learning disabilities</b> - is a functional term rather than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe and some other countries, it 
                refers to intellectual disabilities, while in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries it refers to perceptual disabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Mental health disabilities</b> - includes anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. These conditions may cause 
                difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it. In particular medication for these disorders may have side effects 
                including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Memory impairments</b> - involves limited short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall language. Dementia is one among many 
                different causes of memory impairments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Multiple sclerosis</b> - causes damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and can affect auditory, cognitive, physical, or visual abilities, 
                in particular during relapses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Neurodiversity</b> - is a societal rather than medical term to describe the natural diversity in neurocognitive functioning, like gender, ethnicity, sexual 
                orientation, and disability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Perceptual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries)</b> - involves difficulty processing 
                auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers (dyscalculia), or 
                spatial and temporal orientation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Seizure disorders</b> - includes different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies 
                or patterns.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of barriers for people with cognitive, learning and neurological disabilities: 
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context.
              </li>
              <li>
                Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off.
              </li>
              <li>
                Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio.
              </li>
              <li>
                Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Another element of cognitive disability that I think is important is triggers. For those with panic related disorders, especially C-PTSD and PTSD, 
              imagery or sounds related to trauma can lead to panic attacks. Providing trigger warnings for potentially sensitive content (such as sexual assault)
              and sudden loud noises is important. 
            </p>

            <h4>Physical</h4>
            
            <p>
              Physical disabilities (sometimes called “motor disabilities”) include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, 
              lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of physical disabilities:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Amputation</b> - includes missing fingers, limbs, or other parts of the human body.
              </li>

            <h4>Speech</h4>

            <p>
              Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example, the loudness or 
              clarity of someone's voice might be difficult to understand.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of speech disabilities: 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Apraxia of speech (AOS)</b> - includes inconsistent articulation and production of speech sounds, and errors producing sounds in the correct order 
                so that spoken words or phrases become difficult to understand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cluttering (also called “tachyphemia”)</b> - includes increased speaking rate, incorrect rhythm, intonation, and co-articulation of sounds, and other 
                influent speech that is sometimes similar to stuttering.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Dysarthria</b> - involves weakness or complete paralysis of muscles that are necessary to produce speech, including lips, lungs, throat, tongue, and others.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Speech sound disorder</b> - involves difficulty or inability to produce certain sounds or patterns of sound and sometimes results in addition, distortion, 
                omission, or substitution of such sounds with others.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Stuttering</b> - includes influent speech, repetition of individual sounds or entire words and phrases, and misplacement or prolongation of pauses and sounds 
                while speaking that is different from cluttering.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Muteness (also called “mutism”)</b> - involves the inability to speak due to various reasons such as anxiety, brain injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech.

              </li>
              <li>
                Websites that offer phone numbers as the only way to communicate with the organizations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Visual</h4>

            <p>
              Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes 
              (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. 
              These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some examples of visual disabilities:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Color blindness</b> - includes difficulty distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability 
                to perceive any color.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Low vision</b> - (in some regions also called “partial sight”) includes poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the 
                visual field), central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Blindness</b> - substantial, uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Deaf-blindness</b> - substantial, uncorrectable visual and hearing impairments.

            <p>
              Here are some examples of barriers for people with visual disabilities: 
            </p>

            <ul>

              </li>
              <li>
                Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids.
              </li>
              <li>
                Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tools and Techniques</h4>

            <p>
              There are also a wide variety of tools that disabled people navigating the web may use. Often, they are refered to as assistive technology. 
              Assistive technologies should be kept in mind while coding; make sure that your website is compatable with assistive technologies!
            </p>

            <p>
              Some common assistive technologies and preferences to think about when coding are screen readers and keyboard only users. Screen readers are often 
              utilized by visually impaired people, and they read out the screen to the user. This is why coding semantically is so important, you want to make sure 
              that the text on your website is readable to someone with a screen reader! Users also might be unable to use a mouse, and they will instead "tab through"
              the content on your webpage. Make sure that your content is tab friendly!
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people may also be feeling your website, such as reading through a braille reader or vibration. Some people may also be unable to hear any audio 
              content on your website, and can only see it. 
            </p>

            <p>
              People may also make adjustments to your website to make it easier for them to understand and distinguish. They could make audio content easier to hear 
              and visual content easier to see, combine audio and visual content to make information easier to understand, or use alternate presentations of context, 
              such as sign language. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of users using their keyboard only through the tab method, some people may only be able to use a touch screen, use mouse and keyboard software 
              that accomadates for things like hand tremors, or use voice recognition. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Navigating and finding things on your website is also important. It should be clear to a user where to go and how to get there, and people may need more 
              guidance if it is thier first time on a website. It's also important to consider users who aren't as computer literate, or on a variety of devices. 
            </p>

            <h3>User Profiles</h3>

            <p>
              Essential to understanding how to code accessibly is understanding who we're coding for. This is common practice in many professional spaces (such as marketing), 
              but creating a user profile of a potential user of your web application is a great way to think about this. I've selected a few profiles from UX Magazine 
              as examples, but 
              feel free to explore more! 
            </p>

            <h4>Trevor: High School Student with Autism</h4>

            <figure>
              <img src="./img/trevorUDFinal.png" alt="white cartoon teen with brown hair leaning over a tablet">
            </figure>

            <p>
              Trevor is a bright 18-year-old who plays games and watches music videos on his laptop. He lives at home with his parents and younger sister. He attends 
              a special school where the teachers and staff can help with his social and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disorder, while he works to 
              pass his high school exams.
            </p>

            <p>
              He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the page, and his reading skills are not helped by his trouble concentrating on the 
              page or screen long enough to read. His teachers showed him how to make the text bigger on the page, and told him how to use a printable view to hide 
              all the ads with moving images that distract him, because he reads every word on the page very carefully and literally. He can be easily confused by 
              colloquialisms and metaphors. He can also be overwhelmed by sites that offer too many choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              He likes using the school's forum to talk to his friends. It's easier to just read what they want to say than to listen and try to figure out their 
              facial expressions.
            </p>

            <p>
              He shares a laptop with the family, but has first dibs on it because his parents want him to get his schoolwork done. He uses it for homework, but he 
              really likes games with repetitive actions. He doesn't like new sites much, in the same way that he doesn't like any changes in his routine: 
              they are tolerated, but not encouraged.
            </p>

            <h4>Emily: Cerebral Palsy, Living Independently</h4>

            <figure>
              <img src="./img/emilyUDFinal.png" alt="white cartoon woman with brown hair in a scooter">
            </figure>

            <p>
              Emily is determined to do things for herself, so she's tried a lot of different keyboards and joysticks over the years, looking for the right kind of 
              interaction. Speech is difficult for her, so she uses a communications program with speech output.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's slow for her to type with limited use of her fingers. She has stored many phrases and sentences, and can make the program speak for her more easily.
            </p>

            <p>
              The iPad turned out to be one of the best solutions. Mounted on the scooter, it's always within reach, and touch works better than a keyboard and a 
              joystick. In some situations, it can replace her older communications program.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instant messaging and social media have also been great. The short formats work well for her, and text can be a more comfortable way to communicate than speech.
            </p>

            <p>
              Her latest discovery is an app that scans the area to show her what shops and restaurants are in each direction. “I look like a dancing fool spinning my scooter 
              around, but it saves me a lot of time finding someplace new.”
            </p>

            <h4>Carol: Grandmother with Macular Degeneration</h4>

            <figure>
              <img src="./img/carolUDFinal.png" alt="elderly white woman with white hair reading a book with a cat in her lap">
            </figure>

            <p>
              Carol has always loved reading, so her fading eyesight is a real sorrow to her. She tried recorded books, but she didn't like listening instead of 
              seeing the words in front of her.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a bookkeeper for 25 years, she made the transition from ledgers to a software program, so she's happy to use the computer. She has an old home computer, 
              which she uses the same way she always did her work—carefully checking everything as she goes. She loves getting emails from her grandkids (and a few friends). 
              She likes reading magazine articles online, especially when they are free. Last year, she discovered that she could get her prescriptions more cheaply online, 
              and now she buys some things from the web.
            </p>

            <p>
              Her biggest problem is that the text is so small. She's learned how to click on the symbol to make the text bigger, but is frustrated when it doesn't work 
              the same way on every site.
            </p>

            <p>
              She also finds that her hands aren't as steady as they used to be, and she can't always click on things accurately. She likes her “old fashioned” mobile 
              phone with large buttons that she can feel easily.
            </p>

            <p>
              As her eyes get worse, she wonders how long she'll be able to keep using the computer. All that light gray text on a white screen. It's just too hard 
              to see. Maybe it's really better for younger people.
            </p>

            <p>
              For each of these profiles, think about the three A's: ability, aptitude and attitude. Then, think about the assistive technology they use regularly. 
              How can you create websites that are usable for them? I encourage you to seek out different profiles beyond these, and think about the ways that you can 
              adapt your websites for them.
