    <h3>about me</h3>

    <p>Hi! I'm Lily, a Creative Technology and Design major with a minor in Art Practices at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

        I have an interest in design and web development. I'm still exploring where I can go with this amazing major.
        
        I'm also an experienced freelance digital illustrator. I've actively been doing commission work for four years; including poster designs, character concepts and complex illustrations.
    </p>
