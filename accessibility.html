            <h2>Accessibility</h2>

            <h3>Accessibility Evaluation Tools</h3>
      
            <p>
              There are tons of great tools out there that can help you evaluate webpage accessibility. In our class, we frequently use the web browser extension WAVE 
              from WebAIM, which checks your website for errors and contrast errors. It helps you ensure that your website is properly outlined, and will point out 
              things like if your alt descriptions for images are too long! 
            </p>

            <p>
              HTML outliners are also great tools to check if your page is all properly outlined. We use Web Developer, another web browser extension (which also has a 
              ton of other useful features), to check this. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Making use of the HTML nu validator is also a great step! It will check through your website and point out any missteps in your code that could lead to 
              lack of accessibility. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, make sure to aquaint yourself with the WCAG 2.1 Section 508 guidelines, which will help you know what to look out for when coding. 
            </p>

            <h3>The Mobile Web</h3>

            <p>
              For many people, the only access they have to the internet is through mobile devices, such as phones and tablets. This makes it essential that your code works 
              on both mobile and PC. Your layout should be clear on mobile. Make sure that anything tappable is large enough for the user to tap. Keep in mind that some disabled 
              users may have physical disabilties involving hand tremors, which makes this all the more essential. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The importance of mobile web cannot be understated. Many developers are moving towards "mobile first" design, where you first code your website for mobile, and 
              then adapt it for desktop. This ensures a smooth mobile experience for all users. All of the tennants of web accessibility apply to your mobile designs, so 
              keep that in mind!
