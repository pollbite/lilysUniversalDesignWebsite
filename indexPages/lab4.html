      <p>
        For this project, we were tasked with creating an accessible CSS grid layout. This was my first time ever 
        learning about and using an accessible CSS grid layout, as my last web class was mostly self taught. I found 
        this method extremely useful! This totally changed the game for me when it came to making webpage layouts and 
        made a lot of things make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also learned a lot from my mistakes in this lab. I didn't know it was bad practice to create two navs (I did this 
        for layout purposes), and I didn't know you had to label any image sections you had.
