      <p>
        This project was assigned to me in my text class, where I was tasked with creating a food product that 
        reflected my personal branding and aesthetic. I chose to make strawberry milk!
      </p>

      <p>
        This simple milk brand calls upon cute aesthetics to provide a personal consumer experience. 
        Bubbly fun and gentle typography and graphics are paired with soft, muted colors to represent a empathetic 
        approach to cows. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Approaching this project, I wanted to understand what colors and designs I wanted to represent with my packaging. 
        I spent time putting together mood boards to help me conceptualize my idea. I selected images that represented the colors 
        I wanted, as well as images of packaging from other brands that inspire me. My goal was to show clear inspiration from these 
        images, yet make my design unique and personal.
      </p>

      <p>
        I spent some time laying out all the content that I wanted to layout on my diecut. I knew that I was going to create a 
        milk carton, and I thought that strawberry milk would best represent the themes I was exploring. I designed a mascot character 
        as my main face of the brand. Here, I wanted to create an identifiable brand image that didn't rely on text alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my content layouts, I also established color palettes, fonts, nutritional information, food labels, and my company logo.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img class="fullBleedImg" src="../img/content2.jpg" alt="pink text and nutritional labels">
      </figure>

      <p>
        I created a flat mockup of a die cut, finalizing the design. I spent time examining milk brands and how they laid out their content. 
        I wanted to create packaging design that was both realistic and creative. This die cut was specifically created for carton packaging. 
        The intent for this die cut was for the image to be imported into Adobe Dimension to create a visual of the design. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Cute and bubbly were my main goals with this packaging. I wanted consumers to feel as if they were purchasing a product that was both healthy and caring.
